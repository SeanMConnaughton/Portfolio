            <h3 class="container-fluid">Family</h3>
                <p class ="paragraph">My family consists of my wife Amanda, our cat Willow, and Rosie, our dog. My wife and I got married on May 29th, 2022 at a beautiful venue called Driscoll Estate in Taylorsville, Kentucky. Right before getting married, 
                    we bought a house in Louisville, Kentucky. Originally, we are from LaGrange, Kentucky, which is about 15-20 minutes away. This is where my parents and in-laws currently reside. When we are not working, 
                    we both enjoy getting out of the house. We recently got into pickleball, which is a fun and easy-going sport that we enjoy playing with friends and family. The main thing we like to do is take our pup Rosie on walks to get her out of the house!

            <h3 class="container-fluid">Activities</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">I have several hobbies. All ranging from playing guitar to golf. I have been playing guitar for a couple of years now although I took a good break due to school and work. However, one thing I always find time for is fishing. 
                    Whether I am at the beach or at a local pond, I can always find time to sneak a little fishing in. I love it. I bass fish almost every week with my father on our bass boat. We travel all around always on the hunt for a big fish. We love to fish 
                    at Dale Hollow Lake located in Tennessee and Guntersville Lake in Alabama. It is without a doubt my favorite past time when ever I get the chance.
