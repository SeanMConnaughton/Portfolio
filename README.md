# Portfolio
This portfolio will serve as a way to show my accomplishments as someone who is just now learning to code. I will have information about me, projects, contact information, and much more. 
I want this to serve as a way for people to get to know me not only in a professional but personal sense. Since I have just recently dove into the world of programming, I will be including only a couple of different projects that I have done. 
Some as a way to self-study, and others that were required assignments during my time in MIT's xPRO Professional Certificate of Coding class. 

The portfolio itself is a project, so it is a work in progress! I am hoping to continue adding different projects and information throughout my time in my class and as a proceed throughout a professional career in coding. 

Side Note - I am new to GitHub and am still learning how the entire platform works!
