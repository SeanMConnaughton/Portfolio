# Portfolio
This portfolio will serve as a way to show my accomplishments as someone who is just now learning to code. I will have information about me, projects, contact information, and much more. My portfolio will include several different pages. 

The first is going to be my home page, where you will be able to watch an intro video of who I am, what I am doing currently, and how I plan on furthering my career. 

Secondly, you will see a project page. I have not done many but now that I have a portfolio built, I plan on creating more platforms and experimenting as I continue to grow in the realm of development.

I will have an About Me section, showcasing some of my work experience and who I am. This is where I will include several facts about my personal life. 

Finally, my Contact page. I have not fully completed the server code to archive any emails received, however, I did experiment with a little JavaScript to get the page's fundamentals working. 

Roadmap of Future Improvements:
1. Cleaning up the code and creating reusable components
2. Adding server code to get my Contact page fully working and able to save emails once received.
3. Making the Portfolio as a whole more aesthetically pleasing and fun for end users.
4. Add more projects to the Project page as I continue to improve.
5. Make the website more dynamic as a whole. 

I want this to serve as a way for people to get to know me not only in a professional but personal sense. Since I have just recently dove into the world of programming, I will be including only a couple of different projects that I have done. 
Some as a way to self-study, and others that were required assignments during my time in MIT's xPRO Professional Certificate of Coding class. 

The portfolio itself is a project, so it is a work in progress! I am hoping to continue adding different projects and information throughout my time in my class and as I proceed throughout a professional career in coding. 

Side Note - I am new to GitHub and am still learning how the entire platform works!
